Infusion Examples Folder
========================

This folder contains small code examples illustrating how to customize components by overriding
option defaults. These code snippets will be excerpted into our documentation to provide
functioning examples embedded in the docs.

At present, this folder is a sketch of what it will become: Its form will change. We will
create a component designed to extract the relevant portions of the code, markup and styles and
insert them into the docs. The code, markup and styles will need to follow prescribed file-naming
conventions and use specific comment formats to identify relevant portions. These conventions have
not yet been selected or implemented.
